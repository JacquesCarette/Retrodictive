Audience: CS people with a strong PL background, focused on generation, DSLs and the like.
  --> they know PE
  --> they don't know Quantum

Take Home: PE (w/ a touch of symbolic) applied to Quantum Programs can do neat stuff.

Finer grained items to teach:
- Quantum
  - weirdo basis notation (gives names to basis so that you can compute with them!)
  - bit space = 2 points; qbit space = Bloch sphere
  - global reversibility
- Quantum Programs
  - circuits ~~ all the heap, all the time!
- Show examples

Outline:
- Intro to Quantum
  - bit to qubit (as Bloch sphere)
    - 1 basis vector + real direction + abs 1 = boolean
    - 1 basis vector + complex direction + abs 1 = circle
    - 2 basis vectors + complex direction + abs 1 = sphere
    - bunch of bits (product) works "the same"
    - yes, there are qutrits and more generally qudits
  - measurement of qubit
  - superposition is no longer mysterious?
  - physics: global reversibility

- Intro to Quantum Programs
  - classical reversible bit-level programs: not, cnot, ccnot (Toffoli). (c^k)not.
  - Hadamard gate = 1/8 turn in 1D

- Partial Evaluation
  - no really new idea (?) needed beyond "take symbolic seriously"
  - scales like crazy (huge surprise)

- Examples galore
