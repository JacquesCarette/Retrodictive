Things we need to do to turn this into software + paper

* Extend Theseus with multisets with negative multiplicity a la http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/publications/calculemus10-final.pdf 

* Compare to regular Theseus: programs should be much shorter and more elegant

* Compile to regular Theseus

* Show connections to Pi -- generalizing sums and products

* Reason about complexity of reversible programs (actually complexity of the compiled reversible circuits but without necessarily generating the circuits)

* Ultimately want to run Shor’s algorithm and understand where the speed up
  comes from. There is a vague idea that there is negative flow of information
  going backwards in the circuit to implement the "phase kickback" and that
  this ability is crucial for the potential speedup
