# Retrodictive
For exploring symbolic evaluation of quantum circuits, both running forward and, more importantly, backwards.

We do *symbolic execution* of circuits that residualize symbolic constraints. The ideas are rooted
in partial evaluation, even though that's not quite what the resulting code ends up doing.

This repository contains the paper and slide sources. The code is in a different repository, namely [RetroPECode](https://github.com/JacquesCarette/RetroPECode).
