# Retrodictive
For exploring symbolic evaluation of quantum circuits, both running forward and, more importantly, backwards.

We do *symbolic execution* of circuits that residualize symbolic constraints. The ideas are rooted
in partial evaluation, even though that's not quite what the resulting code ends up doing.

The published paper is in the PEPM directory. The code is in execution/RetroPE.
