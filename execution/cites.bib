abstract = {A different way to execute pure LISP programs is presented. It delays the evaluation of parameters and list structures without ever having to perform more evaluation steps than the usual method. Although the central idea can be found in earlier work this paper is of interest since it treats a rather well-known language and works out an algorithm which avoids full substitution. A partial correctness proof using Scott-Strachey semantics is sketched in a later section.},

abstract="This paper attempts to clarify the difference between partial and ordinary computation. Partial computation of a computer program is by definition ``specializing a general program based upon its operating environment into a more efficient program''. It also shows the usefulness of partial computation. Finally, the formal theory of partial computation, technical problems in making it practical, and its future research problems are discussed.",

abstract="We consider basic notions of security for cryptographic hash functions: collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second-preimage resistance. We give seven different definitions that correspond to these three underlying ideas, and then we work out all of the implications and separations among these seven definitions within the concrete-security, provable-security framework. Because our results are concrete, we can show two types of implications, conventional and provisional, where the strength of the latter depends on the amount of compression achieved by the hash function. We also distinguish two types of separations, conditional and unconditional. When constructing counterexamples for our separations, we are careful to preserve specified hash-function domains and ranges; this rules out some pathological counterexamples and makes the separations more meaningful in practice. Four of our definitions are standard while three appear to be new; some of our relations and separations have appeared, others have not. Here we give a modern treatment that acts to catalog, in one place and with carefully-considered nomenclature, the most basic security notions for cryptographic hash functions.",

ABSTRACT = {Prediction is the making of statements, usually probabilistic, about future events based on current information. Retrodiction is the making of statements about past events based on current information. We present the foundations of quantum retrodiction and highlight its intimate connection with the Bayesian interpretation of probability. The close link with Bayesian methods enables us to explore controversies and misunderstandings about retrodiction that have appeared in the literature. To be clear, quantum retrodiction is universally applicable and draws its validity directly from conventional predictive quantum theory coupled with Bayes’ theorem.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we start with basic definitions related to Boolean functions. We consider the algebraic normal form of a Boolean function and the representation of a Boolean function over the Boolean cube. Extended affinely equivalent Boolean functions are defined as is the Walsh-Hadamard transform of a Boolean function. The finite field over F2 and its automorphisms are considered. It is shown how to associate Boolean functions in n variables with functions over the field F2n. We discuss polynomial representations of Boolean and vectorial Boolean functions. Representations of a Boolean function in the trace form and in the reduced trace form are given. Some details on the degree of a Boolean function in the trace form and on monomial functions are presented. The notions introduced in this chapter will be useful throughout the book.}
